                In summary, I will create/use high quailty textures that can supplement low quailty of models.<br>
                In detail, I will add long hairs to the character that can cover whole body or at least their face.<br>

                I will make the character easy to perform high quality animations.<br>
                This will be done by adding many rigs to the parts and spliting up body parts as much as I can.<br>
                The point of making character more creepy is aiming immerse people to the product that is using my outcome.<br>

                        I decided to create arms (or legs) at the back of the character with this joints.

                        Then I had same steps as the arm steps.

                        I made extra decorations on the back, which are 6 arms on the back of the character. I used the joints on the arms to make it.<br>

                        Finally, I moved to armature step. I had a lot of problems with this step.<br>
                        First time when I did this, the legs were moved but too weird.<br>
                        So I decided to try every single methods that I can which was setting X, Y, and Z location, rotation, and other options such as inherit rotation.<br>
                        After trying around 15 times again, I failed to finish it. I think this might be because of the slight different rotations between the bones.

                    <p>
                        Finally, I finished the armature improvement.<br>
                        I followed every single step carefully and then I realized there was a small error.<br>
                        I accidentlly moved the "iklegtarget" bone and this led to the abnormal movement of armature.<br>
                        Now, I fixed it and it work perfectly.
                    </p>
