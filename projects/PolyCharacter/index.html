            <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
            <p>I will use high quailty textures to supplement low quailty of models (poly character)<br>
                so I can make it more scary.<br>
                Also I will make it as detailed as I can to perform great quality.<br>
                Summary, I will create/use high quailty textures that can supplement low quailty of models.<br>
                In detail, I will add long hairs to the character that can cover whole body or at least their face.<br> 
                This will make people to get immersed. Which can increase usability.<br>

                This will include chasing animation, normal walking animations.<br>
                Also I will ensure my scary character works property with great animations.<br>
                Many amount of rigs and creepy postures will also make people to be immersed.<br>

        <div id="Usability">
            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p>I will ensure that the outcome is fit to scary games that has dark theme.<br>
                Also I will add rigs on specific positions such as knee, elbow, and neck.<br>
                I will make the character easy to perform high quality animations.<br>
                This will be done by adding many rigs to the parts and spliting up body parts as much as I can.<br>
                The point of making character more creepy is aiming immerse people to the product that is using my outcome.<br>

                By adding less rigs on less important parts such as fingers because<br>
                I won't use many finger movement.<br>

                        I created a body block with loop cut tool. After cutting all the parts, I moved the points(dots) individually.
                        After that, I had look around with the 3D view, and then I realized the parts are not completely done because the points on Y view were not perfect.

                        Because I made a mistake at the previous part, I couldn't move the points properly.
                        The points were slightly not matched.
